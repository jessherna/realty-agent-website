	<p><span class="reviewer">Laura and Steven</span><br><img src="images/5stars.png"><br>Anup was so knowledgeable, patient and kind with us on our journey to Toronto. He took us to many neighbourhoods and really listened as we narrowed our search. Many visits, phone calls, and emails later we found our perfect house! Thanks Anup for leading, listening, and caring so much as we entered this market, we couldn’t be happier!</p><br>
